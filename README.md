# Money Tracker (Version 2)✌🏻:

- Money Tracker is a web app that will help users to track spent or earned money on a daily and monthly basis by using interactive charts, This will be tablets and PCs version because I'm planning for a separate app for mobile.

#### Version (2) Updates 🧨💣🧨:

- Updates Firebase to version 9.
- Fix random problems with the normal Calculator.
- Fix the User data form where there was a problem with uploading images and form validation.
- Fix charts to be more responsive with different dates(months) change OR years.
- Apply some changes for the UI (More coming in the same version).


## Disclaimer 🎙:

- the Deployment version will be the updated one.
- Sorry for any inconvenience.


## Summary:

>#### The App contain three main parts:<br>

>> `1. Data Visualization:`<br>
    >>> Where all data will display to the user, It contains 2 charts to follow earned or spent money on a daily and monthly basis along with total data section which include all kinds of total data like total earn or spend etc... and last section will be the percentage of use to make easier for clients to use the app through different sections which include all data required for them.<br>

>> `2. User Data:`<br>
    >>> Where the user has the control over adding or updating his data anytime and the reason for that section I used only email and password to register any client so to let the customer feel more interacting with the app I added this section to add his personality like image & name etc...<br>

>> `3. Calculation System:`<br>
    >>> To achieve the maximum benefits for a financial app, I added features like a normal calculator and loan calculator or credit calculator as when many of us will use any financial app searching about this kind of features.
